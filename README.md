I attempted to create two application is iOS using online tutorials.
I thought that this was an engaging project because I do not have
much personal experience with app development, and it’s possible that my
final project my involve an app in some way.

The links to the tutorials can be found here:

I worked by myself for these projects.

The first project that I worked on was a calculator.
This project taught me about simple features in iOS as well
as how to develop in Xcode. Having never coded with Xcode before,
it would have been daunting to jump in without a simpler tutorial like this.
On the whole, the project was much simpler and gave me a good jumping
off point into iOS development.

The second project that I worked on was an image classifier application.
It used Turi create to easily develop a custom model for differentiating
between images of cats and dogs. I had to learn how to build a Turi model
in python and then port that model over to iOS. On the whole, this was
far more complex and taught me a lot more about the syntax of swift.

I wanted to learn more about the many different UI features on iPhone
such as sliders, but I didn’t have the time to incorporate such features
into any of the projects that I developed.
